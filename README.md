# Power-BI-HR-Dashboard

In this project I have identified KPI's for a company to help understand attrition rate across all the different possible areas/metrics to better understand why people 
are switching/leaving the organisation.

Data Preparation and Cleaning:
Imported raw HR analytics data into Power BI.
Utilized Power Query for data cleaning, handling missing values, and ensuring data quality.
Created calculated columns and measures using DAX.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Explored key performance indicators (KPIs):
Attrition rate: Analyzed trends in employee turnover.
Average salary: Investigated salary distribution.
Job profile-wise attrition: Segregated attrition rates by job roles.
Average age: Visualized employee age distribution.
Years at company: Tracked employee tenure.
Total employee count: Displayed headcount.

Dashboard Creation:
Designed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard:
Included KPI visualizations.
Showcased charts and tables for deeper insights.
Highlighted critical metrics for decision-making.
